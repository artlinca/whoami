He is dependent and needs help from others. He feels uneasy when doing things independently. He needs to exert his inner control and business ability, and be honest with others instead of manipulating them."

Often wronged to do things I don't like, angry inside, love and hate extremes. Play a good role in cooperation and coordination. The more harmonious and non-contentious the heart is, the smoother it will be. Sensitivity is an advantage but also an enemy; avoid stubbornness and compromise. Make good use of aesthetic talent"

They can become outstanding people and incite the masses."

Stable on the outside but open on the inside, the contradiction between 4 who likes rules and seeks stability and fears change, and 5 who likes to break stability and seek freedom, resulting in inconsistency between words and deeds. In fact, stability is not limitation, and freedom is not laissez-faire. Balance is the kingly way."
